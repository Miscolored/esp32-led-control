I guess, sharing reverse-engineered APK's Java source code here could be a bit _unethical_, so here is the script to repeat all needed actions (with official Triones app). It downloads the APK and processes it with [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) and [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar), then decompiling the JAR with [Procyon](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon), [CFR](http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/) and [Fernflower](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower). All these decompilers are cool, but sometimes they fail to decompile methods, so you can choose the best decompiled source from three. Also, you'll get APK's resources like `strings.xml` which can be helpful. You don't need any of mentioned tools to be installed.
